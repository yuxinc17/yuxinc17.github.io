Hi, I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Professor [Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/). Before joining UCI, I received my [MPhil in Machine Learning](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the Engineering Department of the University of Cambridge, and BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Edinburgh.

Born from my background in Bayesian statistics and optimization, I'm broadly interested in interleaving deep learning and statistical techniques in a principled and practical way, and applying these theories for reliable and interpretable machine learning. My current research focuses on deep learning methods for survival analysis and prediction with marked temporal point processes, supported by an [NIH Grant](https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=2090).

I was an off-cycle intern at Goldman Sachs in London (in 2021) and a summer intern at Tencent (in 2019) in my hometown Shenzhen.
