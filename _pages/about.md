Hi, I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Professor Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/). Before joining UCI, I received my [MPhil in Machine Learning](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the Engineering Department of the University of Cambridge; my thesis was supervised by [Professor Carl E. Rasmussen](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Edinburgh.

My research has been focusing on deep probabilistic machine learning methods, such as marked temporal point processes for continuous-time event sequences and machine learning for healthcare, supported by an [HPI Fellowship](https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/students/), an [NIH Grant](https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=2090), and a CS Department Dean's Fellowship.

Currently, I'm working as an AI research scientist summer intern at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) (in 2024). I was an off-cycle Strats intern at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) in London (in 2021), and a research software engineer summer intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) (in 2019) in my hometown Shenzhen.
