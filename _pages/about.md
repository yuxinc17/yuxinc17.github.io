I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Professor Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/). Before joining UCI, I received my [MPhil in Machine Learning](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the Engineering Department of the University of Cambridge; my thesis was supervised by [Professor Carl E. Rasmussen](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Edinburgh.

My research has been focusing on general probabilistic machine learning methods, such as probabilistic modeling of continuous-time event sequences and machine learning for healthcare, supported by an [HPI Fellowship](https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/students/), an [NIH Grant](https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=2090), and a CS Department Dean's Fellowship.

In summer 2025, I was a [Google](www.google.com) PhD Software Engineer intern, working on AI data for LLM post-training and evaluation. I also interned as an AI research scientist at [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) in 2024, and have lovely memories for my internships at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) in 2021 (in one of my fav cities, London), and at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) in 2019 (in my hometown Shenzhen).
